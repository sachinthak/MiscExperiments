Studenmund.\n$$ \n\\begin{aligned}\n Q_t &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1P_t + \\beta_2X_t + \\epsilon_{Dt}\\\\\n Q_t &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1P_t + \\alpha_2X_t + \\epsilon_{St}\n \\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  Q_t &= \\text{demanded and supplied quantity at time } t\\\\\n  P_t &= \\text{price at time } t\\\\\n  X_t &= \\text{a ``a demand side'' exogenous variable, such as income}\\\\\n  Z_t &=  \\text{a ``supply side\" exogenous variable, such as weather}\\\\\n  \\epsilon_t &= \\text{error terms}\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\nNote that at equilibrium supply side and demand side quantities are equal. In this system, Quantities $Q_t$ and price $P_t$ are endogenous and determined together. \n\nTo simulate data from such a system we first set the ground truths to the parameters and assign distributions to the noise terms. For the simulation in this experimeriment we set the following:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha_0 &= 0\\\\\n\\alpha_1 &= 1\\\\\n\\alpha_2 &= 1 \\\\\n\\beta_0 &= 0\\\\\n\\beta_1 &= -1\\\\\n\\beta_2 &= 1\\\\\n\\epsilon_{Dt}  &\\sim \\mathcal{N(0,2)}\\\\\n\\epsilon_{St} &\\sim \\mathcal{N(0,4)}\\\\\nr^2(X,Z) &= 0.4\\\\\nX_t  &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(3,1)\\\\\nZ_t  &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(5,4)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe can establish the relationship between $P_t,X_t$ and $Z_t$ by using the equlibrium condition. i.e\n$$\nP_t =  \\frac{1}{\\beta_1-\\alpha_1}\\left(\\alpha_0 -\\beta_0 + \\alpha_2Z_t - \\beta_2X_t + \\epsilon_{St} - \\epsilon_{Dt}\\right)\n$$\n\nOnce $P_t$ is generated the corresponding $Q_t$ can be easily gerated using either one of the supply or demand equations above. \n\nAfter simulating data, I estimated the coefficients $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\beta_1,$ and $\\beta_2$ using both OLS and IV and compared against the ground truth. Clearly the OLS estimates were off compared to the IV estimates. For IV estimates I used two stage least squared method. Something to note here is that in this example I didn't need an outside instrument variable since there were 2 exogenous variables that could be consummed as instruments.",
